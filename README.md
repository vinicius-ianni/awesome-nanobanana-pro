Makeup artists apply lipstick to her (only her hands are visible in the frame). She is wearing a corset decorated with beaded embroidery and crystals with a short fluffy skirt, as well as large feather wings. The image has a "backstage" effect.

The background is a darkly lit room, probably under the podium. The main emphasis is on the girl's face and the details of her costume. Emphasize the expressiveness of the gaze and the luxurious look of the outfit. The photo is lit by a flash from the camera, which emphasizes the shine of the beads and crystals on the corset, as well as the girl's shiny skin. Victoria's Secret style: sensuality, luxury, glamour. Very detailed. Important: do not change the face.

### 1.15. Compact Camera Screen Display
*A photo displayed on a compact digital camera screen*
<img width="400" alt="Camera Screen Display" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G7NVohbbgAcUFBe?format=jpg&name=900x900" />

**Prompt:**
```text
Use facial feature of attached photo. A close-up shot of a young woman displayed on the screen of a compact Canon digital camera. The camera body surrounds the image with its buttons, dials, and textured surface visible, including the FUNC/SET wheel, DISP button, and the "IMAGE STABILIZER" label along the side. The photo on the screen shows the woman indoors at night, illuminated by a bright built-in flash that creates sharp highlights on her face and hair. She has long dark hair falling across part of her face in loose strands, with a soft, slightly open-lip expression. The flash accentuates her features against a dim, cluttered kitchen background with appliances, shelves, and metallic surfaces softly blurred. The mood is candid, raw, nostalgic, and reminiscent of early 2000s digital camera snapshots. Colors are slightly muted with cool undertones, strong flash contrast, and natural grain from the display. No text, no logos inside the photo preview itself.

Scale ratio: 4:5 vertical

Camera: compact digital camera simulation
Lens: equivalent to 28–35mm
Aperture: f/2.8
ISO: 400
Shutter speed: 1/60 with flash
White balance: auto flash
Lighting: harsh direct flash on subject, ambient low light in the background
Color grading: nostalgic digital-camera tones, high contrast flash, subtle display grain, authentic screen glow.

<img width="400" alt="Split View Render" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G7LmGCQWYAAfp47?format=jpg&name=small" />

**Prompt:**
```text
Create a high-quality, realistic 3D render of exactly one instance of the object: [Orange iPhone 17 Pro].
The object must float freely in mid-air and be gently tilted and rotated in 3D space (not front-facing).
Use a soft, minimalist dark background in a clean 1080×1080 composition.
Left Half — Full Realism
The left half of the object should appear exactly as it looks in real life
— accurate materials, colors, textures, reflections, and proportions.
This half must be completely opaque with no transparency and no wireframe overlay.
No soft transition, no fading, no blending.
Right Half — Hard Cut Wireframe Interior
The right half must switch cleanly to a wireframe interior diagram.
The boundary between the two halves must be a perfectly vertical, perfectly sharp, crisp cut line, stretching straight from the top edge to the bottom edge of the object.
No diagonal edges, no curved slicing, no gradient.
The wireframe must use only two line colors:
Primary: white (≈80% of all lines)
Secondary: a color sampled from the dominant color of the realistic half (<20% of lines)
The wireframe lines must be thin, precise, aligned, and engineering-style.
Every wireframe component must perfectly match the geometry of the object.
Strict Single-Object Rule
Render only ONE object in the entire frame.  Render only one physical object.
Do NOT show a second object from any angle. Do NOT show a second object as a reflection, shadow, silhouette, outline, ghost image, or transparency. Do NOT show a second object for comparison or display purposes. Do NOT show both the front and the back separately.
Do NOT show an extra device behind, beside, underneath, or partially hidden.
Only one single object is allowed in the entire frame.
No duplicate objects, no mirrored back-and-front pairings, no reflections showing a second object.
The object must appear alone, floating.
Pose & Lighting:
Apply a natural, subtle tilt + rotation in 3D to make it look like a floating product visualization.
Use soft, neutral global illumination and no shadows under the object.
No extra props, no text, no labels unless explicitly requested.

**Prompt:**
```text
Present a clear, side miniature 3D cartoon view of [YOUR CITY] tallest buildings. Use minimal textures with realistic materials and soft, lifelike lighting and shadows. Use a clean, minimalistic composition showing exactly the three tallest buildings in Sopot, arranged from LEFT to RIGHT in STRICT descending height order. The tallest must appear visibly tallest, the second must be clearly shorter than the first, and the third must be clearly shorter than the second.
All buildings must follow accurate relative proportions: if a building is taller in real life, it MUST be taller in the image by the same approximate ratio. No building may be visually stretched or compressed.
Each building should stand separately on a thin, simple ceramic base. Below each base, centered text should display:
Height in meters — semibold sans-serif, medium size
Year built — lighter-weight sans-serif, smaller size, directly beneath the height text
Provide consistent padding, spacing, leading, and kerning. Write "YOUR CITY NAME" centered above the buildings, using a medium-sized sans-serif font.
 No building top should overlap or touch the text above.Use accurate architectural proportions based on real-world references.Maintain consistent camera angle and identical scale for each building model.
No forced perspective. Use straight-on orthographic-style rendering. Do not exaggerate or stylize size differences beyond proportional accuracy.

Use a square 1080×1080 composition.Use a clean, neutral background. Ensure no extra objects are present.

### 2.16. Cinematic Keyframe Generator
*Generates cinematic keyframes and storyboards from a reference image*
<img width="400" alt="Image" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G64FgZKXMAAXP_g?format=jpg&name=small" />

**Prompt:**
```text
<role>
You are an award-winning trailer director + cinematographer + storyboard artist. Your job: turn ONE reference image into a cohesive cinematic short sequence, then output AI-video-ready keyframes.
</role>

<input>
User provides: one reference image (image).
</input>

<non-negotiable rules - continuity & truthfulness>
1) First, analyze the full composition: identify ALL key subjects (person/group/vehicle/object/animal/props/environment elements) and describe spatial relationships and interactions (left/right/foreground/background, facing direction, what each is doing).
2) Do NOT guess real identities, exact real-world locations, or brand ownership. Stick to visible facts. Mood/atmosphere inference is allowed, but never present it as real-world truth.
3) Strict continuity across ALL shots: same subjects, same wardrobe/appearance, same environment, same time-of-day and lighting style. Only action, expression, blocking, framing, angle, and camera movement may change.
4) Depth of field must be realistic: deeper in wides, shallower in close-ups with natural bokeh. Keep ONE consistent cinematic color grade across the entire sequence.
5) Do NOT introduce new characters/objects not present in the reference image. If you need tension/conflict, imply it off-screen (shadow, sound, reflection, occlusion, gaze).
</non-negotiable rules - continuity & truthfulness>

<goal>
Expand the image into a 10–20 second cinematic clip with a clear theme and emotional progression (setup → build → turn → payoff).
The user will generate video clips from your keyframes and stitch them into a final sequence.
</goal>

<step 1 - scene breakdown>
Output (with clear subheadings):
- Subjects: list each key subject (A/B/C…), describe visible traits (wardrobe/material/form), relative positions, facing direction, action/state, and any interaction.
- Environment & Lighting: interior/exterior, spatial layout, background elements, ground/walls/materials, light direction & quality (hard/soft; key/fill/rim), implied time-of-day, 3–8 vibe keywords.
- Visual Anchors: list 3–6 visual traits that must stay constant across all shots (palette, signature prop, key light source, weather/fog/rain, grain/texture, background markers).
</step 1 - scene breakdown>

<step 2 - theme & story>
From the image, propose:
- Theme: one sentence.
- Logline: one restrained trailer-style sentence grounded in what the image can support.
- Emotional Arc: 4 beats (setup/build/turn/payoff), one line each.
</step 2 - theme & story>

<step 3 - cinematic approach>
Choose and explain your filmmaking approach (must include):
- Shot progression strategy: how you move from wide to close (or reverse) to serve the beats
- Camera movement plan: push/pull/pan/dolly/track/orbit/handheld micro-shake/gimbal—and WHY
- Lens & exposure suggestions: focal length range (18/24/35/50/85mm etc.), DoF tendency (shallow/medium/deep), shutter "feel" (cinematic vs documentary)
- Light & color: contrast, key tones, material rendering priorities, optional grain (must match the reference style)
</step 3 - cinematic approach>

<step 4 - keyframes for AI video (primary deliverable)>
Output a Keyframe List: default 9–12 frames (later assembled into ONE master grid). These frames must stitch into a coherent 10–20s sequence with a clear 4-beat arc.
Each frame must be a plausible continuation within the SAME environment.
</step 4 - keyframes for AI video>

<step 5 - contact sheet output (MUST OUTPUT ONE BIG GRID IMAGE)>
You MUST additionally output ONE single master image: a Cinematic Contact Sheet / Storyboard Grid containing ALL keyframes in one large image.
- Default grid: 3x3. If more than 9 keyframes, use 4x3 or 5x3 so every keyframe fits into ONE image.
Requirements:
1) The single master image must include every keyframe as a separate panel (one shot per cell) for easy selection.
2) Each panel must be clearly labeled: KF number + shot type + suggested duration (labels placed in safe margins, never covering the subject).
3) Strict continuity across ALL panels: same subjects, same wardrobe/appearance, same environment, same lighting & same cinematic color grade; only action/expression/blocking/framing/movement changes.
4) DoF shifts realistically: shallow in close-ups, deeper in wides; photoreal textures and consistent grading.
5) After the master grid image, output the full text breakdown for each KF in order so the user can regenerate any single frame at higher quality.
</step 5 - contact sheet output>

<final output format>
Output in this order:
A) Scene Breakdown
B) Theme & Story
C) Cinematic Approach
D) Keyframes (KF# list)
E) ONE Master Contact Sheet Image (All KFs in one grid)
</final output format>

**Prompt:**
```text
Design a high-quality 3D poster for the movie/novel "Name to be added", first retrieving information about the movie/novel and famous scenes.

First, please use your knowledge base to retrieve information about this movie/novel and find a representative famous scene or core location. In the center of the image, construct this scene as a delicate axonometric 3D miniature model. The style should adopt DreamWorks Animation's delicate and soft rendering style. You need to reproduce the architectural details, character dynamics, and environmental atmosphere of that time, whether it's a storm or a quiet afternoon, naturally integrating into the model's lighting.

Regarding the background, do not use a simple pure white background. Please create a void environment with faint ink wash diffusion and flowing light mist around the model, with elegant colors, making the image look breathable and have depth, highlighting the preciousness of the central model.

Finally, for the bottom layout, please generate Chinese text. Center the novel title with a font that matches the original style. Below the title, automatically retrieve and typeset a classic description or quote about this scene from the original work, using an elegant serif font. The overall layout should be as精致balanced as a high-end museum exhibit label.

Tiny sunbathers float in pastel swim rings, lounge on miniature deck chairs, and slide into the cream pool from a small blue slide.
The background is a soft, warm, lightly textured countertop surface subtle marble or matte stone, evenly lit, no heavy veins or visual noise. 
Keep the scene grounded with soft shadows beneath props and figures.
Surrounding the tin, keep the playful diorama elements: a small wooden deck with micro figures, pastel umbrellas, lounge chairs, and compact handcrafted accessories. Maintain the hovering pastel inflatables and plush cloud-like shapes, but ensure they feel like stylised decorative objects staged above the countertop 
Preserve the soft, high-saturation, toy-like aesthetic with plush textures, pastel gradients, and gentle lighting.

A transparent Christmas bauble hanging by a red ribbon. Inside, a tiny diorama of the person from the reference reimagined as a cute 3d chibi character. He works at a mini futuristic AI desk with three glowing holo-screens showing neural networks and code. Add tiny plants, a mini coffee cup, soft desk lighting, floating UI icons, and snow-glitter at the base. Warm magical Christmas glow, cinematic reflections on glass, cozy high-end diorama aesthetic.

Cinematic lighting, shallow depth of field, soft reflections on the glass, ultra-polished materials, high detail, festive Christmas atmosphere. Whimsical, premium, and heartwarming.

**Prompt:**
```text
--- Prompt ---

Please create a vibrant, child-like crayon-style vertical (9:16) illustration titled "{City Name} Travel Journal."  
The artwork should look as if it were drawn by a curious child using colorful crayons, featuring a soft, warm light-toned background (such as pale yellow), combined with bright reds, blues, greens, and other cheerful colors to create a cozy, playful travel atmosphere.

I. Main Scene: Travel-Journal Style Route Map

In the center of the illustration, draw a "winding, zigzagging travel route" with arrows and dotted lines connecting multiple locations.  
The route should automatically generate recommended attractions based on {Number of Days}:

Example structure (auto-filled with {City Name}-related content):

- "Stop 1: {Attraction 1 + short fun description}"
- "Stop 2: {Attraction 2 + short fun description}"
- "Stop 3: {Attraction 3 + short fun description}"
- …
- "Final Stop: {Local signature food or souvenir + warm closing remark}"

Rules:
- If no number of days is provided, default to a 1-day highlight itinerary.

II. Surrounding Playful Elements (Auto-adapt to the City)

Add many cute doodles and child-like decorative elements around the route, such as:

1. Adorable travel characters
   - A child holding a local snack  
   - A little adventurer with a backpack

2. Q-style hand-drawn iconic landmarks
   - "{City Landmark 1}"
   - "{City Landmark 2}"
   - "{City Landmark 3}"

3. Funny signboards
   - "Don't get lost!"
   - "Crowds ahead!"
   - "Yummy food this way!"  
   (Auto-adjust contextually for the city)

4. Sticker-style short phrases
   - "{City Name} travel memories unlocked!"
   - "{City Name} food adventure!"
   - "Where to next?"

5. Cute icons of local foods
   - "{Local Food 1}"
   - "{Local Food 2}"
   - "{Local Food 3}"

6. Childlike exclamations
   - "I didn't know {City Name} was so fun!"
   - "I want to come again!"

III. Overall Art Style Requirements

- Crayon / children's hand-drawn travel diary style  
- Bright, warm, colorful palette  
- Cozy but full and lively composition  
- Emphasize the joy of exploring  
- All text should be in a cute handwritten font  
- Make the entire page feel like a young child's fun travel-journal entry

Create a harmonious color palette based on this primary color: use saturated shades for the vertical nodes (bars) and semi-transparent, lighter opacity gradients for the flowing paths to ensure a cohesive and professional look. Avoid clashing colors.[Composition & Structure]:
Flow: A horizontal flow from Left (Revenue Sources) to Right (Net Profit).
Texture: The connecting paths (flows) must appear "silky smooth" with elegant Bezier curves, looking like liquid ribbons, not jagged lines.
Iconography: On the left side (Revenue sources), include specific, minimalist flat vector icons representing the business segments (e.g., a car icon for automotive, a cloud icon for services, a chip icon for hardware).
Branding: Place the official [Insert Brand Name Here] logo clearly at the top center or near the central revenue bar.[Details]: High resolution, 4k, sharp typography (sans-serif), professional data visualization layout. The chart clearly distinguishes between Revenue, Gross Profit, Operating Expenses, and Net Profit.

**Prompt:**
```text
You are a professional skin analyst and skincare expert.
The user uploads a close-up photo of their face and may add short notes (age, allergies, current routine, pregnancy, etc.). Use ONLY what you see in the image plus the user text.
 1. Carefully inspect the skin: shine, pores, redness, blemishes, spots, texture, flaking, fine lines, dark circles, etc.
 2. Decide the main skin type: oily, dry, normal, combination, or sensitive.
 3. Identify visible issues: acne/breakouts, blackheads/whiteheads, post-acne marks, hyperpigmentation, redness, enlarged pores, uneven texture, dehydration, fine lines, dark circles, puffiness, etc.

RESPONSE FORMAT (very important)

Your answer must be plain text in this exact structure:
 1. First, write 3–6 short lines describing the skin and problems, for example:

 • overall skin type and how you know
 • where the main issues appear (forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, jawline, under-eyes)
 • how severe they look (mild / moderate / severe).

 2. On a new line, write the word in caps:
SKIN ROUTINE
 3. Under SKIN ROUTINE, give at least 5 numbered steps (1., 2., 3., …).
Each step must include:

 • what to do (e.g. "Cleanser", "Treatment serum", "Moisturizer", "Sunscreen", "Night treatment"),
 • product TYPE and key INGREDIENTS to look for (no brand names),
 • when to use it (AM, PM, or both) and how often,
 • 1 short practical instruction (how to apply, how much, any caution).

Focus on over-the-counter products only (no prescription or medical diagnosis).
If acne or irritation looks very severe or infected, clearly but kindly suggest visiting a dermatologist.
Keep the tone supportive, simple and clear.
