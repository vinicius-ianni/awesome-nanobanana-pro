Intelligent Fill : Replace them with realistic background elements that logically fit the scene (e.g., extend the cobblestone pavement, empty park benches, or grass textures). Consistency : Ensure no blurry artifacts or 'smudges' remain. The filled area must have the same grain, focus depth, and lighting as the rest of the photo.

Please create a vibrant, child-like crayon-style vertical (9:16) illustration titled "{City Name} Travel Journal."  
The artwork should look as if it were drawn by a curious child using colorful crayons, featuring a soft, warm light-toned background (such as pale yellow), combined with bright reds, blues, greens, and other cheerful colors to create a cozy, playful travel atmosphere.

I. Main Scene: Travel-Journal Style Route Map

In the center of the illustration, draw a "winding, zigzagging travel route" with arrows and dotted lines connecting multiple locations.  
The route should automatically generate recommended attractions based on {Number of Days}:

Example structure (auto-filled with {City Name}-related content):

- "Stop 1: {Attraction 1 + short fun description}"
- "Stop 2: {Attraction 2 + short fun description}"
- "Stop 3: {Attraction 3 + short fun description}"
- …
- "Final Stop: {Local signature food or souvenir + warm closing remark}"

Rules:
- If no number of days is provided, default to a 1-day highlight itinerary.

II. Surrounding Playful Elements (Auto-adapt to the City)

Add many cute doodles and child-like decorative elements around the route, such as:

1. Adorable travel characters
   - A child holding a local snack  
   - A little adventurer with a backpack

2. Q-style hand-drawn iconic landmarks
   - "{City Landmark 1}"
   - "{City Landmark 2}"
   - "{City Landmark 3}"

3. Funny signboards
   - "Don't get lost!"
   - "Crowds ahead!"
   - "Yummy food this way!"  
   (Auto-adjust contextually for the city)

4. Sticker-style short phrases
   - "{City Name} travel memories unlocked!"
   - "{City Name} food adventure!"
   - "Where to next?"

5. Cute icons of local foods
   - "{Local Food 1}"
   - "{Local Food 2}"
   - "{Local Food 3}"

6. Childlike exclamations
   - "I didn't know {City Name} was so fun!"
   - "I want to come again!"

III. Overall Art Style Requirements

- Crayon / children's hand-drawn travel diary style  
- Bright, warm, colorful palette  
- Cozy but full and lively composition  
- Emphasize the joy of exploring  
- All text should be in a cute handwritten font  
- Make the entire page feel like a young child's fun travel-journal entry

## 7. Creative Experiments

### 7.1. Cinematic Keyframe Generator

<img width="500" alt="Image" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G64FgZYXUAAg5Wf?format=jpg&name=small" />

**Prompt:**
```text
<role>
You are an award-winning trailer director + cinematographer + storyboard artist. Your job: turn ONE reference image into a cohesive cinematic short sequence, then output AI-video-ready keyframes.
</role>

<input>
User provides: one reference image (image).
</input>

<non-negotiable rules - continuity & truthfulness>
1) First, analyze the full composition: identify ALL key subjects (person/group/vehicle/object/animal/props/environment elements) and describe spatial relationships and interactions (left/right/foreground/background, facing direction, what each is doing).
2) Do NOT guess real identities, exact real-world locations, or brand ownership. Stick to visible facts. Mood/atmosphere inference is allowed, but never present it as real-world truth.
3) Strict continuity across ALL shots: same subjects, same wardrobe/appearance, same environment, same time-of-day and lighting style. Only action, expression, blocking, framing, angle, and camera movement may change.
4) Depth of field must be realistic: deeper in wides, shallower in close-ups with natural bokeh. Keep ONE consistent cinematic color grade across the entire sequence.
5) Do NOT introduce new characters/objects not present in the reference image. If you need tension/conflict, imply it off-screen (shadow, sound, reflection, occlusion, gaze).
</non-negotiable rules - continuity & truthfulness>

<goal>
Expand the image into a 10–20 second cinematic clip with a clear theme and emotional progression (setup → build → turn → payoff).
The user will generate video clips from your keyframes and stitch them into a final sequence.
</goal>

<step 1 - scene breakdown>
Output (with clear subheadings):
- Subjects: list each key subject (A/B/C…), describe visible traits (wardrobe/material/form), relative positions, facing direction, action/state, and any interaction.
- Environment & Lighting: interior/exterior, spatial layout, background elements, ground/walls/materials, light direction & quality (hard/soft; key/fill/rim), implied time-of-day, 3–8 vibe keywords.
- Visual Anchors: list 3–6 visual traits that must stay constant across all shots (palette, signature prop, key light source, weather/fog/rain, grain/texture, background markers).
</step 1 - scene breakdown>

<step 2 - theme & story>
From the image, propose:
- Theme: one sentence.
- Logline: one restrained trailer-style sentence grounded in what the image can support.
- Emotional Arc: 4 beats (setup/build/turn/payoff), one line each.
</step 2 - theme & story>

<step 3 - cinematic approach>
Choose and explain your filmmaking approach (must include):
- Shot progression strategy: how you move from wide to close (or reverse) to serve the beats
- Camera movement plan: push/pull/pan/dolly/track/orbit/handheld micro-shake/gimbal—and WHY
- Lens & exposure suggestions: focal length range (18/24/35/50/85mm etc.), DoF tendency (shallow/medium/deep), shutter "feel" (cinematic vs documentary)
- Light & color: contrast, key tones, material rendering priorities, optional grain (must match the reference style)
</step 3 - cinematic approach>

<step 4 - keyframes for AI video (primary deliverable)>
Output a Keyframe List: default 9–12 frames (later assembled into ONE master grid). These frames must stitch into a coherent 10–20s sequence with a clear 4-beat arc.
Each frame must be a plausible continuation within the SAME environment.

Use this exact format per frame:

[KF# | suggested duration (sec) | shot type (ELS/LS/MLS/MS/MCU/CU/ECU/Low/Worm's-eye/High/Bird's-eye/Insert)]
- Composition: subject placement, foreground/mid/background, leading lines, gaze direction
- Action/beat: what visibly happens (simple, executable)
- Camera: height, angle, movement (e.g., slow 5% push-in / 1m lateral move / subtle handheld)
- Lens/DoF: focal length (mm), DoF (shallow/medium/deep), focus target
- Lighting & grade: keep consistent; call out highlight/shadow emphasis
- Sound/atmos (optional): one line (wind, city hum, footsteps, metal creak) to support editing rhythm

Hard requirements:
- Must include: 1 environment-establishing wide, 1 intimate close-up, 1 extreme detail ECU, and 1 power-angle shot (low or high).
- Ensure edit-motivated continuity between shots (eyeline match, action continuation, consistent screen direction / axis).
</step 4 - keyframes for AI video>

<step 5 - contact sheet output (MUST OUTPUT ONE BIG GRID IMAGE)>
You MUST additionally output ONE single master image: a Cinematic Contact Sheet / Storyboard Grid containing ALL keyframes in one large image.
- Default grid: 3x3. If more than 9 keyframes, use 4x3 or 5x3 so every keyframe fits into ONE image.
Requirements:
1) The single master image must include every keyframe as a separate panel (one shot per cell) for easy selection.
2) Each panel must be clearly labeled: KF number + shot type + suggested duration (labels placed in safe margins, never covering the subject).
3) Strict continuity across ALL panels: same subjects, same wardrobe/appearance, same environment, same lighting & same cinematic color grade; only action/expression/blocking/framing/movement changes.
4) DoF shifts realistically: shallow in close-ups, deeper in wides; photoreal textures and consistent grading.
5) After the master grid image, output the full text breakdown for each KF in order so the user can regenerate any single frame at higher quality.
</step 5 - contact sheet output>

<final output format>
Output in this order:
A) Scene Breakdown
B) Theme & Story
C) Cinematic Approach
D) Keyframes (KF# list)
E) ONE Master Contact Sheet Image (All KFs in one grid)
</final output format>

Expression : Exaggerate the animal's expression to look extremely shocked/judgemental/lazy (based on photo). Accessories : Add cute little doodles like sweat drops, question marks, or sparkles around the head. Text : Add handwritten text at the bottom: 'So Dumb'. Ensure the text style is messy and funny.
